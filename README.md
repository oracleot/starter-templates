# React
This template is created using [Creat React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which is the [Recommended Toolchain](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#recommended-toolchains) proposed by the React team to integrate React if you're learning React or creating a [single-page](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#single-page-application) app.

To start the project, simply run:

    $ npx create-react-app project-name
    $ cd project-name
    $ npm start

`npx create-react-app project-name` bootstraps a new React app in a directory named project-name.   

_[npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b)_ is a package-runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+.   
**Note:** If you've previously installed `create-react-app` globally via `npm install -g create-react-app`, we recommend you uninstall the package using `npm uninstall -g create-react-app` to ensure that npx always uses the latest version.

`cd project-name` changes directory to your new React project directory.   
`npm start` starts the app at `http://localhost:3000/` except you changed your port from 3000.
