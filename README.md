# React
This template is created using [Creat React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which is the [Recommended Toolchain](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#recommended-toolchains) proposed by the React team to integrate React if you're learning React or creating a [single-page](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#single-page-application) app.

To start the project, simply run:

    $ npx create-react-app _project-name_

**[npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b)** is a package-runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+.   
Replace *_project-name_* in the command with your real project name.   
Then, change your directory into the project by running this command: `$ cd project-name`.   
Finally, run: `npm start` to start your React project.

### Next step:
To adapt the structure of this starter-template, simply clone this branch into your project

    $ git clone -b jekyll-template <remote_repo>
